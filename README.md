## Testing content routing of Kademlia DHT (by libp2p)

**IMPORTANT**: this code is just to **test** a libp2p feature based on Kademlia DHT,
it's **not** a full implementation of a p2p network.

**Note 1**: Peers are running **locally**.

**Note 2**: **bootstrap node** must be hardcoded on `main.go`.

**Context**: see https://gitlab.com/nunet/research/core-platform/-/issues/15
